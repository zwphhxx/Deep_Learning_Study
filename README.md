ðŸ§  Deep Learning From Scratch
A personal learning project to systematically study deep learning from the ground up. This repository contains theory notes, hands-on implementations, and practical projects to gradually build understanding and skill in deep learning.

ðŸ“Œ Project Goals
Learn fundamental math for deep learning: linear algebra, calculus, probability

Understand the core concepts of machine learning and neural networks

Implement neural networks from scratch using NumPy

Learn and use deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow

Complete small deep learning projects (e.g., image classification, text analysis)

Build a solid portfolio for job hunting or academic research
