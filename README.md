ðŸ§  Deep Learning From Scratch

A personal learning project to systematically study deep learning from the ground up. This repository contains theory notes, hands-on implementations, and practical projects to gradually build understanding and skill in deep learning.

ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

Understand the core concepts of neural networks

Learn and use deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow

Complete small deep learning projects (e.g., image classification, text analysis)
